DETECTION OF THYROID DISORDER USING MACHINELEARNING APPROACH) 
Abstract: In India, 42 million people suffer from diseases such as thyroid. Humans have a vascular gland called the thyroid that is
one of the most important organs in their bodies. Two hormones are secreted by this gland, which function to control the body's
metabolism. When this disorder occurs in the body, certain hormones are released that imbalances the body's metabolism. Using
Machine Learning, this project is designed to detect thyroid diseases in humans. Importing the dataset is accomplished through a
User Interface. Three different machine learning algorithms are used to construct the model to detect thyroid disease. In this study,
SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes are machine learning techniques used to identify thyroid illness. Using three machine
learning algorithms, the accuracy of the model is shown. The most effective machine learning algorithm for detecting thyroid
disease has been chosen among the various algorithms that have been used.
